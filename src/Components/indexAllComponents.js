// In this JS file we are mapping all the compones to import them in the componen tree aka App.jsx
// in 1 single line

export { default as serviceData } from "./serviceData";
export { default as Nav } from "./Nav";
export { default as Footer } from "./Footer";

// when importing them on the App.jsx file, you can write :

// import { serviceData, Nav, Footer } from "./Component/index"

// watched this in a Youtube short video and found value on it...
